= vGPU Support
:revdate: 2024-12-23
:page-revdate: {revdate}

{harvester-product-name} is capable of sharing NVIDIA GPU support for Single Root IO Virtualization (SR-IOV). This additional capability, which is provided by the **pcidevices-controller** add-on, leverages `sriov-manage` for GPU management. 

To determine if your GPU supports SR-IOV, check the device documentation. For more information about creating an NVIDIA vGPU that supports SR-IOV, see the https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/15.0/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#creating-sriov-vgpu-device-red-hat-el-kvm[NVIDIA documentation].

You must enable the xref:../add-ons/nvidia-driver-toolkit.adoc[nvidia-driver-toolkit] add-on to be able to manage the lifecycle of vGPUs on GPU devices.

== Usage

. On the UI, go to *Advanced -> SR-IOV GPU Devices* and verify the following:
+
* GPU devices have been scanned.
* An associated `sriovgpudevices.devices.harvesterhci.io` object has been created.
+

. Locate the device that you want to enable, and then select *⋮ -> Enable*.
+
image::advanced/sriovgpudevices-enabled.png[]

. Go to the *vGPU Devices* screen and check the associated `vgpudevices.devices.harvesterhci.io` objects.
+
Allow some time for the pcidevices-controller to scan the vGPU devices and for the {harvester-product-name} UI to display the device information.

. Select a vGPU and configure a profile.

+
[NOTE]
====
The list of profiles depends on the GPU and the underlying /sys tree of the host. For more information about the available profiles and their capabilities, see the https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/15.0/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#supported-gpus-grid-vgpu[NVIDIA documentation].

After you select the first profile, the NVIDIA driver automatically configures the profiles available for the remaining vGPUs.
====

. Attach the vGPU to a new or existing VM.
+

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Once a vGPU has been assigned to a VM, it may not be possible to disable the VM until the vGPU is removed.
====

=== Limitations

==== Attaching Multiple vGPUs

Attaching multiple vGPUs to a VM may fail for the following reasons:

* Not all vGPU profiles support attachment of multiple vGPUs. The https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/16.0/grid-vgpu-release-notes-generic-linux-kvm/index.html#multiple-vgpu-support[NVIDIA documentation] lists the vGPU profiles that support this feature. For example, if you use NVIDIA A2 or A16 GPUs, note that only Q-series vGPUs allow you to attach multiple vGPUs.
+
image::advanced/multiplevgpu.png[]

* Only 1 GPU device in the VM definition can have `ramFB` enabled. To attach multiple vGPUs, you must edit the VM configuration (in YAML) and add `virtualGPUOptions` to all non-primary vGPU devices.

==== Cap on Usable vGPUs

When vGPU support is enabled on a GPU, the NVIDIA driver creates 16 vGPU devices by default. After you select the first profile, the NVIDIA driver automatically configures the profiles available for the remaining vGPUs.

The profile used also dictates the maximum number of vGPUs available for each GPU. Once the maximum is exhausted, no profiles can be selected for the remaining vGPUs and those devices cannot be configured.

Example (https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/15.0/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#vgpu-types-nvidia-a2[NVIDIA A2 GPU]):

If you select the `NVIDIA A2-4Q` profile, you can only configure 4 vGPU devices. Once those devices are configured, you cannot select any profiles for the remaining vGPUs.

=== Technical Deep Dive

pcidevices-controller introduces the following CRDs:

* sriovgpudevices.devices.harvesterhci.io
* vgpudevices.devices.harvesterhci.io

On boot, pcidevices-controller scans the host for NVIDIA GPUs that support SR-IOV vGPU devices. When such devices are found, they are represented as a CRD.

When a SRIOVGPUDevice is enabled, the pcidevices controller works with the `nvidia-driver-toolkit` daemonset to manage the GPU devices.

On subsequent scan of the /sys tree by the pcidevices, the vGPU devices are scanned by the pcidevices controller and managed as `VGPUDevices` CRD

When a user enables and selects a profile for the `VGPUDevice` the pcidevices controller sets up the device and sets up the correct profile on the said device.

The pcidevices controller also runs a vGPU device plugin, which advertises the details of the various vGPU profiles to the kubelet. This is then used by the k8s scheduler to place the VM's requesting vGPU's to the correct nodes.

The pcidevices controller also setups the integration with kubevirt and advertises the vGPU devices as externally managed devices in the Kubevirt CR to ensure that the VM can consume the vGPU.
