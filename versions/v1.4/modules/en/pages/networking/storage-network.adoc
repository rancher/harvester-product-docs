= Storage Network
:revdate: 2025-11-12
:page-revdate: {revdate}

{harvester-product-name} uses {longhorn-product-name} to provide block device volumes for virtual machines and pods. If you want to isolate {longhorn-product-name} replication traffic from the Kubernetes cluster network (for example, the management network) or other cluster-wide workloads, you can allocate a dedicated storage network for {longhorn-product-name} replication traffic to get better network bandwidth and performance.

For more information, see https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/storage/1.7/en/longhorn-system/networking/storage-network.html[Storage Network] in the {longhorn-product-name} documentation.

[NOTE]
====
* Avoid configuring {longhorn-product-name} settings directly, as this can result in unexpected or unwanted system behavior.
* You can only use the {longhorn-product-name} storage network with the default V1 Data Engine. Usage with the V2 Data Engine is not yet supported.
====

== Prerequisites

There are some prerequisites before configuring the {harvester-product-name} `storage-network` setting.

* Well-configured Cluster Network and VLAN Config.
+
** Users have to ensure the Cluster Network is configured and VLAN Config will cover all nodes and ensure the network connectivity is working and expected in all nodes.
+
* All VMs should be stopped.
+
** We recommend checking the VM status with the following command and should get an empty result.
+
** `kubectl get -A vmi`
+
* All pods that are attached to {longhorn-product-name} volumes should be stopped.
+
* All ongoing image uploads or downloads should be either completed or deleted.

[CAUTION]
====
If the {harvester-product-name} cluster was upgraded from v1.0.3, please check if Whereabouts CNI is installed properly before you move on to the next step. https://github.com/harvester/harvester/issues/3168[Issue 3168] describes that the {harvester-product-name} cluster will not always install Whereabouts CNI properly.

* Verify the `ippools.whereabouts.cni.cncf.io` CRD exists with the following command.
+
** `kubectl get crd ippools.whereabouts.cni.cncf.io`
+
* If the {harvester-product-name} cluster doesn't have `ippools.whereabouts.cni.cncf.io`, please add https://github.com/harvester/harvester/tree/v1.1.0/deploy/charts/harvester/dependency_charts/whereabouts/crds[these two CRDs] before configuring the `storage-network` setting.

== Configuration example

* VLAN ID
+
** Please check with your network switch setting, and provide a dedicated VLAN ID for storage network.
+
* Well-configured Cluster Network and VLAN Config
+
** Please refer Networking page for more details and configure `Cluster Network` and `VLAN Config` but not `Networks`.
+
* IP range for storage network
+
** IP range should not conflict or overlap with Kubernetes cluster networks(`10.42.0.0/16`, `10.43.0.0/16`, `10.52.0.0/16` and `10.53.0.0/16` are reserved).
+
** IP range should be in IPv4 CIDR format and {longhorn-product-name} pods use storage network as follows:
+
*** `+instance-manager+` pods: Instance Manager components were consolidated in {longhorn-product-name} v1.5.0. The Engine Instance Manager and Replica Instance Manager are now deprecated. One IP is required for each node. During an upgrade, two versions of these pods will exist (old and new), and the old version will be deleted once the upgrade is successful.
+
*** `backing-image-ds` pods: These are employed to process on-the-fly uploads and downloads of backing image data sources. These pods will be removed once the image uploads or downloads are completed.
+
*** `backing-image-manager` pods: 1 IP per disk, similar to the instance manager pods. Two versions of these will coexist during an upgrade, and the old ones will be removed after the upgrade is completed.
+
** The required number of IPs is calculated using a simple formula: `Required Number of IPs = (Number of Nodes * 2) + (Number of Disks * 2) + Number of Images to Download/Upload`
+
Example: If a cluster has five nodes with two disks each, and ten images will be uploaded simultaneously, the IP range should be greater than or equal to `/26` (`(5 * 2) + (5 * 2) + 10 = 30`).
+
* Exclude IP addresses that {longhorn-product-name} pods and the storage network must not use, such as addresses reserved for xref:/integrations/rancher/csi-driver.adoc#_rwx_volume_support[RWX volume support], the gateway, and other components.

We will take the following configuration as an example to explain the details of the storage network.

* VLAN ID for storage network: `100`
* Cluster network: `storage`
* IP range: `192.168.0.0/24`
* IP address to be excluded: `192.168.0.1/32`

== Configuration process

{harvester-product-name} creates a Multus `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` from the configuration, stops pods related to {longhorn-product-name} volumes, updates {longhorn-product-name} settings, and restarts previous pods.

=== Before applying the `storage-network` setting

Here we have two cases.

* Expect that VM VLAN traffic and {longhorn-product-name} storage network use the same group of physical interfaces.
* Expect that VM VLAN traffic and {longhorn-product-name} storage network use different physical interfaces.

{longhorn-product-name} will send replication traffic through the specific interfaces shown as the red line in the figure.

==== Same physical interfaces

Take `eth2` and `eth3` as an example for VM VLAN traffic and {longhorn-product-name} storage network simultaneously.

Please refer Networking page to configure `ClusterNetwork` and `VLAN Config` with `eth2` and `eth3` and remember the `ClusterNetwork` name for the further step.

image::storagenetwork/storagenetwork-same.png[storagenetwork-same.png]

==== Different physical interfaces

`eth2` and `eth3` are for VM VLAN Traffic. `eth4` and `eth5` are for {longhorn-product-name} storage network.

Please refer Networking page to configure `ClusterNetwork` and `VLAN Config` with `eth4` and `eth5` for storage network and remember the `ClusterNetwork` name for the further step.

image::storagenetwork/storagenetwork-diff.png[storagenetwork-diff.png]

=== `storage-network` setting

The xref:../installation-setup/config/settings.adoc#_storage_network[`storage-network` setting] allows you to configure the network used to isolate in-cluster storage traffic when segregation is required.

You can <<Enable the storage network,enable>> and <<Disable the storage network,disable>> the storage network using either the UI or the CLI. When the setting is enabled, you must construct a Multus `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD by configuring certain fields.

==== {harvester-product-name} UI

[TIP]
====
Using the {harvester-product-name} UI to configure the `storage-network` setting is strongly recommended.
====

===== Enable the storage network

. Go to *Advanced -> Settings -> storage-network*.

. Select *Enabled*.

. Configure the *VLAN ID*, *Cluster Network*, *IP Range*, and *Exclude* fields to construct a Multus `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD.

. Click *Save*.

image::storagenetwork/storage-network-enabled.png[Storage network enabled]

===== Disable the storage network

. Go to *Advanced -> Settings -> storage-network*.

. Select *Disable*.

. Click *Save*.

Once the storage network is disabled, {longhorn-product-name} starts using the pod network for storage-related operations.

image::storagenetwork/storage-network-disabled.png[Storage network disabled]

==== CLI

You can use the following command to configure the xref:../installation-setup/config/settings.adoc#_storage_network[`storage-network` setting].

[,bash]
----
kubectl edit settings.harvesterhci.io storage-network
----

The storage network is automatically enabled in the following situations:

* The `value` field contains a valid JSON string.
+
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: storage-network
value: '{"vlan":100,"clusterNetwork":"storage","range":"192.168.0.0/24", "exclude":["192.168.0.100/32"]}'
----

* The `value` field is empty.
+
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: harvesterhci.io/v1beta1

kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: storage-network
----

[CAUTION]
====
{harvester-product-name} considers extra insignificant characters in a JSON string as a different configuration.
====

==== Change the MTU of the storage network

Follow the instructions in xref:./cluster-network.adoc#_change_the_mtu_of_a_network_configuration_with_an_attached_storage_network[Change the MTU of a network configuration with an attached storage network].

=== After applying the `storage-network` setting

{harvester-product-name} will stop all pods that are related to {longhorn-product-name} volumes. Currently, {harvester-product-name} has some pods listed below that will be stopped during setting.

* Prometheus
* Grafana
* Alertmanager
* VM Import Controller

{harvester-product-name} will also create a new `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` and update the {longhorn-product-name} storage network setting.

Once the {longhorn-product-name} setting is updated, {longhorn-product-name} will restart all `instance-manager` and `backing-image-manager` pods to apply the new network configuration, and {harvester-product-name} will restart the pods.

[NOTE]
====
{harvester-product-name} will not start VM automatically. Users should check whether the configuration is completed or not in the next section and start VM manually on demand.
====

=== Verify that the configuration is completed

==== Step 1

Check if the `storage-network` setting's status is `True` and the type is `configured`.

[,bash]
----
kubectl get settings.harvesterhci.io storage-network -o yaml
----

----

==== Step 2

Verify the readiness of all {longhorn-product-name} `instance-manager` and `backing-image-manager` pods, and confirm that their networks are correctly configured.

Execute the following command to inspect a pod's details:

[,bash]
----
kubectl -n longhorn-system describe pod <pod-name>
----

If you encounter an event resembling the following one, the storage network might have run out of its available IPs:

Please reconfigure the storage network with a sufficient IP range.

[NOTE]
====
If the storage network has run out of IPs, you might encounter the same error when you upload/download images. Please delete the related images and reconfigure the storage network with a sufficient IP range.
====

==== Step 3

Check the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/network-status` annotations and ensure that an interface named `lhnet1` exists, with an IP address within the designated IP range.

Users could use the following command to show all Instance Manager to verify.

[,bash]

==== Step 4

The storage network is dedicated to <<Same physical interfaces,internal communication between {longhorn-product-name} pods>>, resulting in high performance and reliability. However, the storage network still relies on the xref:./deep-dive.adoc#_external_networking[external network infrastructure] for connectivity (similar to how the xref:./vm-network.adoc#_create_a_vm_with_vlan_network[VM VLAN network] functions). When the external network is not connected and configured correctly, you may encounter the following issues:

* The newly created VM becomes stuck at the `Not-Ready` state.
* The `longhorn-manager` pod logs include error messages.

Example:

----
longhorn-manager-j6dhh/longhorn-manager.log:2024-03-20T16:25:24.662251001Z time="2024-03-20T16:25:24Z" level=error msg="Failed rebuilding of replica 10.0.16.26:10000" controller=longhorn-engine engine=pvc-0a151c59-ffa9-4938-9c86-59ebb296bc88-e-c2a7fe77 error="proxyServer=10.52.6.33:8501 destination=10.0.16.23:10000: failed to add replica tcp://10.0.16.26:10000 for volume: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to get replica 10.0.16.26:10000: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 10.0.16.26:10000: connect: no route to host\"" node=oml-harvester-9 volume=pvc-0a151c59-ffa9-4938-9c86-59ebb296bc88
----

To test the communication between {longhorn-product-name} pods, perform the following steps:

4.1 Obtain the storage network IP of each Instance Manager pod (one per node) identified in the previous step.

Example:

----
instance-manager-43f1624d14076e1d95cd72371f0316e2
storage network IP: 10.0.16.8

instance-manager-ba38771e483008ce61249acf9948322f
storage network IP: 10.0.16.14
----

4.2 Log in to those pods.

When you run the command `ip addr`, the output includes IPs that are identical to IPs in the pod annotations. In the following example, one IP is for the pod network, while the other is for the storage network.

Example:

[,console]
----
$ kubectl exec -i -t -n longhorn-system instance-manager-ba38771e483008ce61249acf9948322f -- /bin/sh

$ ip addr

169.254.1.1 dev eth0 scope link
----

[NOTE]
====
The storage network link always inherits the MTU value of the attached xref:./cluster-network.adoc#_cluster_network[cluster network], regardless of the configured xref:./cluster-network.adoc#_change_the_mtu_of_a_network_configuration_with_an_attached_storage_network[MTU value].
====

4.3 Start a simple HTTP server in one pod.

Example:

 $ python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 10.0.16.14 (replace with your pod storage network IP)

[NOTE]
====
Explicitly bind the simple HTTP server to the storage network IP.
====

4.4 Test the HTTP server in another pod.

Example:

----
From instance-manager-43f1624d14076e1d95cd72371f0316e2 (IP 10.0.16.8)

$ curl http://10.0.16.14:8000
----

When the storage network is functioning correctly, the `curl` command returns a list of files on the HTTP server.

4.5 (Optional) Troubleshoot issues.

The storage network may malfunction because of issues with the external network, such as the following:

* Physical NICs (installed on {harvester-product-name} nodes) that are associated with the storage network were not added to the same VLAN in the external switches.
* The external switches are not correctly connected and configured.

=== Start virtual machines manually

After verifying the configuration, users could start VM manually on demand.

== Best practices

* When configuring an <<Configuration example,IP range>> for the storage network, ensure that the allocated IP addresses can service the future needs of the cluster. This is important because {longhorn-product-name} pods (`instance-manager` and `backing-image-manager`) stop running when new nodes are added to the cluster or more disks are added to a node after the storage network is configured, and when the required number of IPs exceeds the allocated IPs. Resolving the issue involves reconfiguring the storage network with the correct IP range.

* Configure the storage network on a non-`mgmt` cluster network to ensure complete separation of the {longhorn-product-name} replication traffic from the Kubernetes control plane traffic. Using `mgmt` is possible but not recommended because of the negative impact (resource and bandwidth contention) on the control plane network performance. Use `mgmt` only if your cluster has NIC-related constraints and if you can completely segregate the traffic.
