= Edit a Volume

After creating a volume, you can edit your volume by clicking the `⋮` button and selecting the `Edit Config` option.

== Expand a Volume

You can expand a volume by increasing the value of the `Size` parameter directly. To prevent the expansion from interference by unexpected data R/W, {harvester-product-name} supports `offline` expansion only. You must shut down the VM or detach the volume first if it is attached to a VM, and the detached volume will automatically attach to a random node with https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/storage/1.8.0/en/introduction/concepts.html#_2_volumes_and_primary_storage[maintenance mode] to expand automatically.

== Cancel a Failed Volume Expansion

If you specify a size larger than {longhorn-product-name}'s capacity during the expansion, the status of the volume expansion will be stuck in `Resizing`. You can cancel the failed volume expansion by clicking the `⋮` button and selecting the `Cancel Expand` option.

== Change the StorageClass of an Existing Volume

The StorageClass of an existing volume cannot be changed. However, you can change the StorageClass while restoring a new volume from the snapshot by following the steps below:

. xref:./volume-snapshots.adoc#_create_volume_snapshots[Take a volume snapshot].
. Select StorageClass when xref:./volume-snapshots.adoc#_restore_a_new_volume_from_a_volume_snapshot[restoring the volume using snapshot].
