IP Pool is a built-in IP address management (IPAM) solution exclusively available to {harvester-product-name} load balancers (LBs).

== Features

* *Multiple IP ranges:* Each IP pool can contain multiple IP ranges or CIDRs.
* *Allocation history:* The IP pool keeps track of the allocation history of every IP address and prioritizes assigning previously allocated addresses by load balancer name.

----
status:
  allocatedHistory:
    192.168.178.8: default/rke2-default-lb-pool-2fab9ac0
----

* *Scope:* IP pools can be confined to a particular network, project, namespace, or guest cluster.

== Creating an IP pool

. On the {harvester-product-name} UI, go to *Networks -> IP Pools*.
. Select *Create*.
. Specify a name for the IP pool.
. On the *Range* tab, specify one or more IP ranges.

. On the *Selector* tab, specify the priority level and scope (namespace) of the IP pool.

=== Creating an IP pool using the Rancher UI

If you imported the {harvester-product-name} cluster into {rancher-short-name}, you can create an IP pool using the {rancher-short-name} UI (*Virtualization Management* -> IP Pool: Create*). However, the *Scope* section on the *Selector* tab requires you to specify the project and guest Kubernetes cluster, in addition to the namespace. For more information, see xref:integrations/rancher/virtualization-management.adoc#_multi_tenancy_example[Multi-Tenancy Example] and https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/rancher-manager/latest/en/cluster-admin/manage-clusters/projects-and-namespaces.html#_about_projects[Projects and Kubernetes Namespaces with Rancher].

An IP pool is designated as a global resource when the *Scope* section contains only one entry with the *Project*, *Namespace*, and *Guest Kubernetes Cluster* fields set to *All*.

== Selection policy

Each IP pool will have a specific range, and you can specify the corresponding requirements in the LB `annotations`. IP pools that meet the specified requirements will automatically assign IP addresses to LBs.

* LBs utilize the following annotations to express requirements (all annotations are optional):
 ** `loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/network` specifies the VM network the guest cluster nodes use.
 ** `loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/project` and `loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/namespace` identify the project and namespace of the VMs that comprise the guest cluster.
 ** `loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/cluster` denotes the name of the guest cluster.
* The IP pool has a selector, including network and scope, to match the requirements of the LB.
 ** Network is a hard condition. The optional IP pool must match the value of the LB annotation `loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/network`.
 ** Every IP pool, except the global IP pool, has a unique scope different from others if its priority is `0`. The project, namespace, or cluster name of LBs should be in the scope of the IP pool if they want to get an IP from this pool.
* `spec.selector.priority` specifies the priority of the IP Pool. The larger the number, the higher the priority. If the priority is not `0`, the value should differ. The priority helps you to migrate the old IP pool to the new one.
* If the IP Pool has a scope that matches all projects, namespaces, and guest clusters, it's called a global IP pool, and only one global IP pool is allowed. If there is no IP pool matching the requirements of the LB, the IPAM will allocate an IP address from the global IP pool if it exists.

=== Examples

* *Example 1:* You wish to set up an IP pool within the range `192.168.100.0/24` for the `default` namespace. In this scenario, all load balancers within the `default` namespace will receive an IP address from this designated IP pool:
+
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: default-ip-pool
spec:
  ranges:
  - subnet: 192.168.100.0/24
  selector:
    scope:
      namespace: default
----

* *Example 2:* You have a guest cluster `rke2` deployed within the network `default/vlan1`, and its `project/namespace` name is `product/default`. If you want to configure an exclusive IP pool range `192.168.10.10-192.168.10.20` for it. Refer to the following `YAML` config:
+
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: rke2-ip-pool
spec:
  ranges:
  - subnet: 192.168.10.0/24
    rangeStart: 192.168.10.10
    rangeEnd: 192.168.10.20
  selector:
    network: default/vlan1
    scope:
    - project: product
      namespace: default
      guestCluster: rke2
----

* *Example 3:* If you have specified the IP pool `default-ip-pool` for the `default` namespace, you want to migrate the IP pool `default-ip-pool` to a different IP pool `default-ip-pool-2` with range `192.168.200.0/24`. It's not allowed to specify over one IP pool for the same scope, but you can give the IP pool `default-ip-pool-2` a higher priority than `default-ip-pool`. Refer to the following `YAML` config:
+
[,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: networking.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
  kind: IPPool
  metadata:
    name: default-ip-pool-2
  spec:
    ranges:
    - subnet: 192.168.200.0/24
    selector:
      priority: 1  # The priority is higher than default-ip-pool
      scope:
        namespace: default
----

* *Example 4:* You want to configure a global IP pool with a CIDR range of `192.168.20.0/24`:
+
[,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: global-ip-pool
labels:
  loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/global-ip-pool: 'true' # Added by the controller automatically
spec:
  ranges:
  - subnet: 192.168.20.0/24
  selector:
    scope:
    - project: "*"
      namespace: "*"
      guestCluster: "*"
----

== Allocation policy

* The IP pool prioritizes the allocation of previously assigned IP addresses based on their allocation history.
* IP addresses are assigned in ascending order.

== Best practices

=== IP pool for VM type load balancer

* Create an IP pool <<Creating an IP pool,using the {harvester-product-name} UI>>, which leaves the scope selector's *Project* and *Guest Kubernetes Cluster* fields blank.

* If you must <<Creating an IP pool using the Rancher UI,use the {rancher-short-name} UI>>, set the *Project* and *Guest Kubernetes Cluster* fields to either *All* or *None*.

=== IP pool for guest cluster type load balancer

* Create an IP pool <<Creating an IP pool using the Rancher UI,using the {rancher-short-name} UI>>, which allows you to specify the target project and guest Kubernetes cluster for better resource management and isolation.

* Exercise caution when creating global IP pools. A single guest cluster can exhaust the entire pool, leaving other clusters unable to provision services. Additionally, you cannot delete a pool if any of the addresses are still in use.
