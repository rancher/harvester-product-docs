=== Replica rebuilding for detached cloned {longhorn-product-name} volumes

When you clone a detached {longhorn-product-name} volume in a multi-node cluster, {longhorn-product-name} creates only _one replica_ instead of the expected number (for example, three replicas in a three-node cluster). The displayed volume clone status is `copy-completed-awaiting-healthy` instead of `complete`.

{longhorn-product-name} automatically rebuilds the remaining replicas after the cloned volume is attached to a virtual machine. However, you can start the replica rebuilding process immediately for the detached volume by performing either of the following actions:

* On the {longhorn-product-name} UI, manually attach the volume and wait for the replica rebuilding process to be completed.

* Enable the {longhorn-product-name} setting https://documentation.suse.com/cloudnative/storage/latest/en/high-availability/offline-replica-rebuilding.html[`offline-replica-rebuilding`] to allow automatic rebuilding of replicas for detached volumes.

[NOTE]
====
This behavior applies exclusively to detached volumes. {longhorn-product-name} automatically performs replica rebuilding for volumes that are attached to a running virtual machine.
